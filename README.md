## 📖 About The Project

Aetherium is a comprehensive showcase of a modern, full-stack, event-driven application. It simulates a city grid where hundreds of autonomous vehicle agents navigate from a start to a destination point, obeying traffic signals.

The core innovation is an AI optimization engine that observes traffic patterns in real-time. It collects data on congestion and wait times to make intelligent decisions, dynamically adjusting the duration of green/red lights to minimize jams and reduce the average travel time for all vehicles.
